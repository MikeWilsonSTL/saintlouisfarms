# Saint Louis Farms

Final project for LaunchCode's 2023 Liftoff Program.

Saint Louis Farms is a full-stack web application that enables farmers to sell their products directly to consumers.

The application was designed with three types of users in mind: farmers, clients, and non-authenticated users.

Farmers have the ability to set up a store. They can manage their inventory by uploading, deleting, and updating items. Farmers can customize their store settings according to their needs. They have access to a dashboard that provides real-time updates on past orders well as a profile section. Two different product views are available for farmers: a condensed table view for inventory management and a store preview option that allows them to see how products will appear for clients.

Clients can conveniently place orders from farms using a shopping cart feature. They can also track the live status of their orders in through three stages: unconfirmed, confirmed, and fulfilled. The system will automatically adjust the inventory of ordered items to ensure availability. Additionally, clients have access to a comprehensive order history log where they can review all of their purchases.

Non-authenticated users are able to browse all farms but cannot place orders. Any attempt made by non-authenticated users to perform actions other than viewing farms or stores will be redirected to the login page.
